**Bedrock** (Also known as **Adminium**) is an indestructible block that makes up the underground borders. It cannot be mined nor placed by regular players.

Bedrock is used at spawn to create a platform for players to spawn on that is indestructible to griefers, without actually having to protect the spawn.

There also exists a technical block called **Invisible Bedrock** which is an invisible but collidable block that is used to prevent players from going out of bounds where regular bedrock doesn't exist.
