**Wool** blocks are colourful blocks used for making pixel art or the like.

## Classic
This was the original colour palette, providing 16 different colours, some which are very vibrant.

{% include wools.html
	id_start=site.data.wool.classic.start_id
	wools=site.data.wool.classic.colors %}

## CPE
In CPE CustomBlocks v1, the wool colour palette was expanded with five colours to compliment the original set of wool colours.

{% include wools.html
	id_start=site.data.wool.cpe.start_id
	wools=site.data.wool.cpe.colors %}

## Custom
These wool colours were added in Voxelmanip Classic to further expand the palette of colours.

{% include wools.html
	id_start=site.data.wool.custom.start_id
	wools=site.data.wool.custom.colors %}
