Since the 13th of March 2023, the code that runs the Voxelmanip Classic server is fully open source, with the code licensed under the MIT license.

Ever since the Voxelmanip Classic game refactor, all the server's mods are stored in a monorepo as a game that the server runs. It is now fully independent of the (now essentially obsolete) Minecraftn't Classic game.

### It can be found on GitHub at: <https://github.com/rollerozxa/voxelmanip-classic>
