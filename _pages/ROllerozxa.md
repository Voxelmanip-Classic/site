ROllerozxa is the owner, administrator, developer and soused herring enjoyer of Voxelmanip Classic.

Most of the time when he is online he has probably forgotten that Luanti is even running in the background, though he sometimes is active and builds things.



## Lore
You might witness the mystical creature known as ROllerozxa hovering high up in the sky, seemingly unresponsive. If you are lucky you might even witness him down on the surface, building or wandering around. With the appearance of the dark fluffy boy, he is the prince of Voxelmanip Classic.

Legends say he has the power of the Voxel Manipulator within him, being able to manipulate nodes at a fast rate with what he says is called "World Edit". He also has the power to control time, rolling back events that have happened in the world.
